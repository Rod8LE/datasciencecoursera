# Getting and Cleaning Data

The code is separated into modules by comments

Each comments defines what is the idea of the code+

The code should:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

VERY IMPORTANT - the file downloaded is a zip file that should be extracted MANUALLY after download

the code returns and writes a .txt file with the "tidy data" on the working directory
